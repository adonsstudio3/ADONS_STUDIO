# 🎥 Hero Video Upload & Looping - FIXED!

## Problem
1. Uploaded hero video not playing on homepage
2. Single video not looping properly

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Video Source Handling**

**Issue:** The video source was being encoded regardless of whether it's a Supabase URL or local path, which could break Supabase URLs.

**Fix:** Added smart URL detection:
```javascript
// Don't encode if it's already a full URL (Supabase)
if (originalSrc.startsWith('http')) {
  v.src = originalSrc
} else {
  // encode URI to handle filenames with spaces or special characters for local paths
  v.src = encodeURI(originalSrc)
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Both Supabase uploaded videos and local videos now work correctly

---

### 2. **Loop Attribute for Single Videos**

**Issue:** Loop was set in JSX but not dynamically updated when playlist changed.

**Fix:** Added dynamic loop setting:
```javascript
// Set loop attribute directly on video element for single video
v.loop = playlist.length === 1

console.log('🔁 Loop enabled:', v.loop, 'Playlist length:', playlist.length)
```

**Result:** ✅ Single videos now have `loop` attribute set correctly

---

### 3. **Manual Loop Fallback**

**Issue:** If browser's native loop fails, video would just stop.

**Fix:** Added manual restart on `onEnded` event for single videos:
```javascript
const onEnded = () => {
  // If only one video, it should loop naturally via the loop attribute
  // But if loop fails, manually restart
  if (playlist.length === 1) {
    console.log('🔁 Single video ended, restarting...')
    setTimeout(()=>{
      try {
        const video = videoRef.current
        if (video) {
          video.currentTime = 0
          video.play().then(()=> setPlaying(true)).catch(()=> setPlaying(false))
        }
      } catch(e){ console.error('Manual loop failed', e) }
    }, 50)
  } else {
    // Advance to next clip for multi-video playlist
    setCurrent(i => (i + 1) % (playlist.length))
    // ... play next video
  }
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Even if native loop fails, video will restart automatically

---

### 4. **Added Debug Logging**

Added console logs to help debug video loading:
```javascript
console.log('🎥 Loading video:', originalSrc)
console.log('🔁 Loop enabled:', v.loop, 'Playlist length:', playlist.length)
console.log('🔁 Single video ended, restarting...')
```

**Result:** ✅ Easy to see in console if video is loading and loop is working

---

### 5. **Updated Effect Dependencies**

**Issue:** Effect didn't re-run when playlist length changed.

**Fix:** Added `playlist.length` to dependencies:
```javascript
}, [current, playlist.length])
```

**Result:** ✅ Loop behavior updates when you add/remove videos

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Single Video (Playlist Length = 1)
1. Video element has `loop` attribute set to `true`
2. Browser plays video in native loop
3. If loop fails, `onEnded` event manually restarts video
4. Video plays infinitely ♾️

### Multiple Videos (Playlist Length > 1)
1. Video element has `loop` attribute set to `false`
2. When video ends, advances to next video
3. Last video wraps around to first video
4. Carousel continues infinitely ♾️

## 🔍 Testing Your Uploaded Video

### Check Console Logs

Open browser console (F12) and look for these messages:

**When page loads:**
```
🔍 Fetching hero sections...
📥 Hero sections response: {...}
🎬 Final playlist: [{...}]
```

**When video starts playing:**
```
🎥 Loading video: https://your-supabase-url.../video.mp4
🔁 Loop enabled: true Playlist length: 1
```

**If video ends (single video):**
```
🔁 Single video ended, restarting...
```

---

### Verify Video is Playing

1. **Open homepage:** `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Check hero section:** Should see your uploaded video playing
3. **Wait for video to end:** Should restart automatically (if only 1 video)
4. **Check console:** Should see loop messages

---

### If Video Still Not Playing

**Check these in order:**

1. **Verify upload succeeded:**
   - Go to admin panel
   - Check if hero section shows your video
   - Verify it's marked as "Active"

2. **Check video URL:**
   - Open console (F12)
   - Look for: `🎥 Loading video: ...`
   - Copy the URL and open it directly in browser
   - If 403 or 404 error → Supabase storage policy issue

3. **Check video format:**
   - Supported: `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.ogg`
   - Recommended: MP4 (H.264 codec)
   - If unsupported format → convert to MP4

4. **Check Supabase storage:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
   - Find your video file
   - Click to get public URL
   - Make sure bucket is public (or RLS policy allows access)

5. **Check network tab:**
   - F12 → Network tab
   - Filter: "Media"
   - Reload page
   - Should see video request with 200 status

## 🎨 Expected Behavior

### Single Video Upload
```
User uploads 1 video via admin
↓
Hero section fetches from database
↓
Shows that 1 video
↓
Video plays with loop=true
↓
When video ends, restarts from beginning
↓
Infinite loop ♾️
```

---

### Multiple Videos Upload
```
User uploads 3 videos via admin
↓
Hero section fetches from database
↓
Shows video 1 (loop=false)
↓
Video 1 ends → Switch to video 2
↓
Video 2 ends → Switch to video 3
↓
Video 3 ends → Back to video 1
↓
Infinite carousel ♾️
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Video URL Issues

**Problem:** Video URL from Supabase not loading

**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase storage bucket is public
2. Or add RLS policy:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public Access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'your-bucket-name');
```

---

### Video Format Issues

**Problem:** Browser doesn't support video format

**Solution:**
- Use MP4 with H.264 codec (most compatible)
- Convert using: https://www.freeconvert.com/video-converter
- Or use ffmpeg:
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4
```

---

### Video Too Large

**Problem:** Video takes too long to load

**Solution:**
- Compress video (aim for < 10MB)
- Use https://www.videosmaller.com
- Or reduce resolution to 1920x1080 max

---

## ✅ Summary

All issues fixed:

- ✅ Supabase uploaded videos now work (proper URL handling)
- ✅ Local videos still work (with URL encoding for special chars)
- ✅ Single video loops infinitely (both native loop + manual fallback)
- ✅ Multiple videos cycle infinitely
- ✅ Debug logging added for troubleshooting
- ✅ Demo videos removed (only shows your uploaded content)

---

**Your hero section is now fully dynamic with proper video playback and looping!** 🎉

**Next steps:**
1. Upload a video through admin panel
2. Mark it as "Active"
3. Check console for debug messages
4. Video should play and loop automatically

If you still have issues, share the console logs and I can help debug further!
