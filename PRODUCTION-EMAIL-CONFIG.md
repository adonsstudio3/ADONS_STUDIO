## 📍 Where Email is Configured

### 1. Contact Form API
**File:** `app/api/contact/route.js`
```javascript
// What's actually sent via Resend API:
from: 'ADONS Contact Form <onboarding@resend.dev>',  // ✅ Actually used
to: 'adonsstudio3@gmail.com',  // ✅ Set here
reply_to: submission.email  // ✅ User's email for replies
```

**Note:** The code has an unused variable `emailData.from: 'noreply@adons-studio.com'` which is just a placeholder. The actual sender is `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's free test domain - pre-verified and ready to use).

---

## 🎯 What is `onboarding@resend.dev`?

**It's Resend's FREE test domain** provided to all users:
- ✅ **Pre-verified** - no DNS setup needed
- ✅ **Free forever** - included in free tier (3,000 emails/month)
- ✅ **Works immediately** - no configuration required
- ✅ **Production-ready** - perfectly fine for real use

**Why you don't see "verify email" option:**
- If you signed up with `adonsstudio3@gmail.com`, it's **automatically verified** ✅
- You can already send and receive emails!
- Verification is only needed if you want to send to OTHER emails besides your signup email

### 2. Admin User Setup
**File:** `app/api/setup-admin/route.js`
```javascript
const adminEmail = 'adonsstudio3@gmail.com';  // ✅ Admin email
```

### 3. Authentication
**File:** `app/api/auth/route.js`
```javascript
if (email !== 'adonsstudio3@gmail.com') {  // ✅ Only this email can login
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 403 });
}
```

### 4. Database (admin_users table)
**Supabase:** `admin_users` table has entry:
```sql
email: 'adonsstudio3@gmail.com'
role: 'super_admin'
is_active: true
```
