# 🎉 Contact Form Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Wrong

### Problem 1: Form Not Calling API
The contact form was **only logging to console** and showing an alert:
```javascript
// OLD CODE (Wrong)
console.log('Form submitted:', formData);
alert('Message sent successfully!');
```

**It never called `/api/contact`!**

### Problem 2: No Submissions in Database
Since the form never called the API, nothing was saved to `contact_submissions` table.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1️⃣ Added Actual API Call
```javascript
// NEW CODE (Fixed)
const response = await fetch('/api/contact', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: fullName,
    email: formData.email,
    phone: phoneNumber,
    subject: formData.subject,
    message: formData.message
  })
});
```

### 2️⃣ Added Loading State
- Button shows "Sending..." while submitting
- Button is disabled during submission

### 3️⃣ Added Success/Error Messages
- Green success message after successful submission
- Red error message if something goes wrong
- Messages auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

### 4️⃣ Form Resets After Success
- All fields clear automatically
- Ready for next submission

## 🔍 Debugging

### If submission doesn't save:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for error messages
3. Check Network tab for `/api/contact` request
4. Status should be **201 Created**

### If email doesn't send:
1. Check server console for:
   ```
   ✅ Email sent successfully via Resend
   ```
2. If you see:
   ```
   ⚠️ RESEND_API_KEY not configured
   ```
   Then restart dev server!

### If you get errors:
1. **429 Too Many Requests** → Wait 5 minutes (rate limit)
2. **400 Bad Request** → Check form validation
3. **500 Server Error** → Check server console logs

## 📧 Email Configuration

### Current Settings:

| **Reply-To** | User's email from form |
| **Template** | From `email_templates` table |

### To Change Recipient:
In `app/api/contact/route.js` line 127:
