# Netlify Redirects for Next.js
# ================================
# These rules handle routing for Next.js deployed on Netlify
# Note: Vercel handles this automatically - this file is only for Netlify deployments

# Redirect www to non-www (or vice versa - choose one)
# https://www.your-domain.com/* https://your-domain.com/:splat 301!

# Force HTTPS
# http://your-domain.com/* https://your-domain.com/:splat 301!

# Remove trailing slashes (SEO best practice)
# This should be processed before other rules
/*/ /:splat 301!

# Admin login page redirect (if needed)
/admin /admin/login 301

# Legacy URL redirects (add your old URLs here)
# /old-path /new-path 301

# API routes - let Next.js handle them (no redirect)
/api/* 200

# Next.js pages - let the framework handle routing
# The "!" ensures this is a forced redirect, not a rewrite
