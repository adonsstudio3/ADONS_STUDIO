## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Environment
- [ ] Save all unsaved work
- [ ] Backup current code (git branch)
- [ ] Ensure git is up to date

### Step 2: Apply Changes
```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd e:\Websites\Adons\frontend

# Verify changes
git status

# Review changes
git diff contexts/AdminContext.js
git diff components/admin/DashboardOverview.js
```

### Step 3: Install & Run
```powershell
# Kill existing process
npx kill-port 3000

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Initial Testing
- [ ] Dev server starts without errors
- [ ] No console errors on load
- [ ] Dashboard loads normally
- [ ] Activity logs visible

---

## Test Scenarios

### Test A: Tab Switching (Critical)
```
Objective: Verify no loading state on tab switch
Steps:
1. [ ] Open http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard
2. [ ] Wait for full load (stats visible, activity logs loaded)
3. [ ] Press Ctrl+Tab to switch to another tab
4. [ ] Wait 5 seconds
5. [ ] Press Ctrl+Shift+Tab to return to dashboard tab
6. [ ] Observe dashboard

Expected Result:
✅ No loading spinner appears
✅ Stats numbers visible immediately
✅ Activity logs still there
✅ Dashboard is responsive

Status: ___________
```

### Test B: Creating Content (Critical)
```
Objective: Verify no loading state on action
Steps:
1. [ ] Keep admin dashboard in focus
2. [ ] Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console
3. [ ] Create a new project (or upload media)
4. [ ] Watch activity log for update
5. [ ] Observe page during and after action

Expected Result:
✅ No page reload occurs
✅ No loading spinner appears
✅ Activity log updates instantly
✅ No console errors
✅ Console shows Realtime event: "🔔 Activity log realtime event"

Status: ___________
```

### Test C: Multiple Tab Switches (Stress Test)
```
Objective: Verify stability with rapid tab switching
Steps:
1. [ ] Open admin dashboard
2. [ ] Wait for full load
3. [ ] Rapidly switch tabs (Ctrl+Tab) 5-10 times
4. [ ] Return to dashboard
5. [ ] Observe

Expected Result:
✅ Dashboard always responsive
✅ No loading spinner ever appears
✅ Data always consistent
✅ No console errors

Status: ___________
```

### Test D: Network Monitoring (Performance)
```
Objective: Verify API call reduction
Steps:
1. [ ] Open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab
2. [ ] Reload dashboard page
3. [ ] Filter by "stats" API call
4. [ ] Note number of requests
5. [ ] Perform an action (create project)
6. [ ] Note number of requests

Expected Result:
✅ Only 1 "stats" API call on page load
✅ No additional stats calls on action
✅ No stats API call on tab switch
✅ Total requests < 5 for full session

Status: ___________
```

### Test E: Realtime Functionality (Integration)
```
Objective: Verify Realtime still works after changes
Steps:
1. [ ] Open admin dashboard
2. [ ] Open a second browser tab to same dashboard
3. [ ] In first tab, create a new project
4. [ ] Observe second tab activity log
5. [ ] Verify activity appears in both tabs

Expected Result:
✅ Activity appears in both tabs instantly
✅ Both tabs update in sync
✅ No lag between tabs
✅ Realtime subscription active (check console)

Status: ___________
```

### Test F: Stats Persistence (Caching)
```
Objective: Verify stats are cached and don't reload unnecessarily
Steps:
1. [ ] Note all stats numbers (Projects: X, Showreels: Y, etc.)
2. [ ] Switch tabs multiple times
3. [ ] Return to dashboard
4. [ ] Compare stats numbers

Expected Result:
✅ Stats numbers unchanged after tab switch
✅ No additional API calls made
✅ Stats still visible immediately

Status: ___________
```

### Pre-Production
- [ ] All tests passed locally
- [ ] Code reviewed for quality
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] No breaking changes to other features
- [ ] Documentation complete and clear

### Production Deploy
- [ ] Backup production code
- [ ] Deploy changes to production
- [ ] Monitor for errors
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Verify load times

### Post-Production
- [ ] Real users testing scenarios A-E

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur
```bash
# Revert changes
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Restart server
npx kill-port 3000
npm run dev
```

### Success Criteria for Rollback Decision
- More than 1% user-reported loading states
- API errors > 0.1%
- Performance regression > 10%
- Console errors on every page load

---

## Monitoring & Support

### What to Monitor

#### Browser Console (F12)
```
✅ Should see:
"🚀 First mount - loading dashboard data"
"📊 Loading dashboard stats..."
"✅ Dashboard stats received: {stats}"
"✅ Realtime subscription active for activity logs"

❌ Should NOT see:
Multiple "Loading dashboard..." messages
"Auto-refresh" or "forceRefresh" calls
"Error" or "failed" messages
"undefined" references
```

#### Network Tab (F12 → Network)
```
✅ Should see:
1 request to /api/admin/dashboard/stats on page load
WebSocket connection to Realtime server
0 additional stats calls on actions/tab switches

❌ Should NOT see:
Multiple /api/admin/dashboard/stats calls
Repeated GET requests
High latency (> 1 second)
Failed requests
```

#### Performance Metrics
```
✅ Good metrics:
Dashboard load time: < 1 second
Tab switch time: instant (< 100ms)
API response time: < 500ms
WebSocket latency: < 100ms
Memory usage: stable (no leaks)

❌ Bad metrics:
Dashboard load time: > 3 seconds
Tab switch: > 500ms
API response: > 2 seconds
Memory growing continuously
High CPU usage
```
