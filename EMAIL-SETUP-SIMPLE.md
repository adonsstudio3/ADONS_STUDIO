The email will come from `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's test domain). This is:
- ✅ **Free** (no domain needed)
- ✅ **Reliable** (Resend's infrastructure)
- ✅ **Legitimate** (not spam)
- ⚠️ Shows "via resend.dev" in Gmail

### If You Want a Custom Sender Later
If you ever want emails to come from `contact@adons.studio` instead:
1. Buy domain `adons.studio`
2. Verify it in Resend (add DNS records)
3. Update sender in code
4. That's it!

But **for now, test domain works perfectly!** ✅
