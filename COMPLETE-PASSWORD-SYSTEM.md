# ✅ COMPLETE - Password Management System Implementation

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

I've successfully implemented a complete password management system for your ADONS admin panel with **TWO features**:

---

## 1. 🔒 Password Change (For Logged-In Users)

**When to use**: User knows their current password and wants to change it

**Location**: `/admin/change-password` (requires login)

**Process**:
1. Enter current password
2. Receive OTP via email (5 minutes)
3. Enter OTP + new password + confirm
4. Password changed!

**Files**:
- `app/api/admin/send-password-otp/route.js` - Sends OTP
- `app/api/admin/change-password/route.js` - Changes password with OTP verification
- `components/admin/ChangePassword.js` - UI component
- `components/admin/ChangePassword.module.css` - Styles

---

## 2. 🔓 Password Reset (For Forgotten Passwords)

**When to use**: User forgot their password

**Location**: `/reset-password` (public, no login required)

**Process**:
1. Enter email address
2. Receive OTP via email (10 minutes)
3. Enter OTP + new password + confirm
4. Password reset! Redirected to login

**Files**:
