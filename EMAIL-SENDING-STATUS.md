# 📧 Email Sending Status & Next Steps

## ✅ What's Working Now

- ✅ Contact form saves to Supabase `contact_submissions` table
- ✅ Form shows success message
- ⚠️ **Email sending partially working** (needs Resend verification)

## ⚠️ Current Issue: Domain Not Verified

The email is trying to send from `contact@adons.studio`, but Resend says:
```
❌ The adons.studio domain is not verified. 
   Please add and verify your domain on https://resend.com/domains
```

## 🔧 Quick Fix Applied: Using Test Domain

I changed the sender from:
```javascript
from: 'ADONS Studio <contact@adons.studio>'  // ❌ Not verified
```

To:
```javascript
from: 'ADONS Contact Form <onboarding@resend.dev>'  // ✅ Resend's test domain
```

## 📬 Testing with Test Domain

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Test Domain Limitation
Resend's test domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`) can **ONLY send emails to the email address you signed up with on Resend**.

### To Test Right Now:

1. **Make sure `adonsstudio3@gmail.com` is the email you used to sign up on Resend**
   - If yes → emails will work! ✅
   - If no → you need to verify `adonsstudio3@gmail.com` in Resend

2. **Submit a test contact form**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000/contact`
   - Fill out form
   - Submit

3. **Check your Gmail inbox**
   - Look for email from "ADONS Contact Form <onboarding@resend.dev>"
   - Subject: "New Contact Form Submission - [Name]"
   - Should arrive within 30 seconds

4. **Check server console**
   - Should see: `✅ Email sent successfully via Resend: [email-id]`
   - If you see error, read below

## 🎯 Two Options for Production

### Option 1: Verify Your Domain (Recommended for Production)

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter: `adons.studio`
4. Add the DNS records they provide to your domain registrar:
   - SPF record
   - DKIM record
   - MX record (optional)
5. Wait 5-30 minutes for verification
6. Once verified, update `app/api/contact/route.js`:
   ```javascript
   from: 'ADONS Studio <contact@adons.studio>',
   ```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Professional email address
- ✅ Better deliverability
- ✅ No sending limits
- ✅ Can send to any email

### Option 2: Add Test Email Recipients (Quick Test)

If you just want to test without domain setup:

1. Go to https://resend.com/settings
2. Find "Test mode" or "Verified emails"
3. Add `adonsstudio3@gmail.com`
4. Verify it (check Gmail for verification email)
5. Now test emails will work!

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Only sends to verified emails
- ⚠️ Shows "via resend.dev" in inbox
- ⚠️ Not professional for production

## 🧪 Test After Changes

1. **Restart dev server** (to reload changes):
   ```bash
   Ctrl+C
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Submit contact form**

3. **Check server console** for:
   ```
   ✅ Email sent successfully via Resend: re_xxxxx
   ```

4. **Check Gmail inbox** for notification email

## 🐛 Common Errors

### Error: "The adons.studio domain is not verified"
**Fix:** Using test domain now (`onboarding@resend.dev`), but emails only go to verified addresses.

**Action:** Add `adonsstudio3@gmail.com` as verified email in Resend settings.

### Error: "Recipient not verified"
**Meaning:** Test domain can only send to email you signed up with.

**Action:** 
- Add recipient email as verified in Resend dashboard, OR
- Verify your custom domain

### Error: "Invalid API key"
**Fix:** Check `.env.local` has correct `RESEND_API_KEY`

**Action:** 
```bash
# Check if key exists
cat .env.local | grep RESEND
```

### No error but no email received
**Check:**
1. Gmail spam folder
2. Server console for `✅ Email sent successfully`
3. Resend dashboard → Logs → Check if email was sent

## 📊 Current Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
